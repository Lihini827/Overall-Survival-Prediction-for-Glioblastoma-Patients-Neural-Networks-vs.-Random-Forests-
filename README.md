# Overall-Survival-Prediction-for-Glioblastoma-Patients-Neural-Networks-vs.-Random-Forests-
A balanced random forest and an artificial neural network were used for survival prediction, with radiomics data augmented using Gretel.ai.

1.Missing values in both datasets were handled using the KNN-5 Imputer:- KNNImputterRadiomics1.ipynb

2.Radiomics data was augmented using the Gretel.ai tool to increase dataset diversity:-SyntheticGretel.ipynb

3.The balanced random forest method was applied to address imbalanced class distribution:-balanced_random_4PCA.ipynb,_14_6Clinical2balanced_random__4PCA.ipynb,2origicorrelation95.ipynb

4.Two models were developed for survival classification:
